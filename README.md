# Data-Link-Layer-Protocols-Simulation
 
### A simulation for the transmission of messages between two data link layers
1. One coordinator between the two nodes to start and stablish the connection between the two nodes
2. Using framing with byte stuffing for each package sent 
3. Detecting errors happening in during the transmission
4. Correcting the message using hamming code method
5. Out the connection summary in an output file
