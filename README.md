# Data-Link-Layer-Protocols-Simulation
 
### A simulation for the transmission of messages between two data link layers
1. One coordinator between the two nodes to start and establish the connection between the two nodes
2. Using framing with byte stuffing for each package sent 
3. Detecting errors happening during the transmission
4. Correcting the message using the Hamming code method
5. Output the connection summary in an output file
